# Description =============================================================================================
'''
This script was written during and for the bachelor thesis "Assembly and Programming of a
Robot Monkey to Study Imitation Learning in Marmosets". 

It is intended to be used with the robot monkey assembled during the mentioned thesis. 
Once all setup steps as described on the ReadMe on the source repository and in the appendix of the thesis have been completed, 
this script can be run on e.g a Raspberry Pi to control the mentioned robot monkey or a different robot. 

This script launches a ROS node subscribed to the 'joint_states' topic which continuously listens to incoming target joint state data.
It then uses the newest data in 'joint_states' to update the servo motors duty cycles accordingly. 

The servo motor installed in the robot monkey during the thesis is the KST A12-T, whose rotational range can be covered by setting the duty cycle of a PWM signal to [4.5,10.5] %. 
The rotational range of the mechanical joint is 180° 
However, effects such as friction and varying tension make it such that the servos can often not pull hard enough at the threads to achieve the full ROM.
Thus, each Joint object in this script has its own so called predefined states, namely {min,middle,max,def}, which contain the duty cycle for a particular joint (and servo) for a particular state.
The states are not based on the duty cycle range based on the data sheet, but rather on the duty cycles which, when applied to the servos, 
lead to them e.g reaching their lower/upper rotational limit as permitted by the mentioned effects. Similarly, 
the middle and def value are the duty cycles for two other useful states, to which the user can then to refer to on a higher level. 
The 'def' state refers to the duty cycle the servo must have, such that the joint corresponding to the servo is at an angle such that the planning group of which the joint is part of (e.g left arm) is in its resting position.

To reduce jitter, the PiGPIOFactory from gpiozero is used. 
As a consequence, the final value written to the servo motor has to be in [-1,1].
To make use of the predefined states (especially min,max) mapping functions were created which take the following things into account:
- potentially inversed attachment of threads to servo wheel
- different angle ranges of joints (comes from URDF, which in turn comes from the URDF exporter from SolidWorks)
